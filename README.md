Poker in C++
I wanted to play poker in C++, so I built it.
This project includes:

A custom Hand class for storing and managing cards (no STL containers â€” just raw arrays).
Logic to find the best possible poker hand from any set of cards (e.g., pair, flush, straight).
Full support for a standard 52-card deck.
Cards are stored in sorted order, and you can add, clear, and print them. The program can recognize all major poker hands and returns the highest-ranking one possible from the cards given.
